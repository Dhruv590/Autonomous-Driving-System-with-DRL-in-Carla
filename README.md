# Autonomous-Driving-System-with-DRL-in-Carla
Developed an advanced autonomous driving system using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in the Carla simulator. The project integrates multi-sensor data (camera, LIDAR, radar) for enhanced perception and decision-making. Achieved reduced collision rates and improved lane-keeping accuracy through extensive training.
